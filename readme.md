This project is an assignment of Digital Image Processing course. I finished this project with Pengchen Lian.



In this project, we practiced several image processing skills including wavelet transform, histogram equalization, and homomorphic filtering. With these methods, we completed several tasks, namely image denoising, edge extraction, and low-light image enhancement.



My work is mainly on Project 2. In Project 2, to enhance the low-light images, I implemented the global histogram equalization algorithm and local ones, comparing their performances with PSNR and SSIM indices, analyzing the mechanisms behind the results. I also tried several kinds of filters in both the spatial domain and the frequency domain, observing how the parameters in filters influence the quality of processed images. In the second part of the bonus question, I adopted the homomorphic filter under different color models to learn how this method differs from histogram equalization in low-light image enhancement tasks.
